## 🎯 Overview

Weekflow is a sleek, browser-based weekly planner designed for anyone who values clean design and powerful functionality. Built with vanilla JavaScript and no build step, it's fast and private.

For now: No accounts, no cloud sync, no subscriptions—just open the file and start planning. All your data stays in your browser, making it perfect for those who prioritize privacy and simplicity.

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use It Online and Install It
1. Visit the [live app](https://briakgodfrey.github.io/weekflow) (GitHub Pages)
2. Install it as an app (optional, see below). After the first visit it works offline.

### Option 2: Download and Run Locally
1. Download or clone the whole repo (the app needs the `css/`, `js/`, `vendor/`, and `assets/` folders, not just `index.html`)
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Start planning!

> Opening the file directly works fine, but installing and the offline cache need the app to be served over `https://` (or `http://localhost`). To try the full app locally, run `python3 -m http.server` in the project folder and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## 📲 Install as an App

Weekflow is a Progressive Web App (PWA): a website you can install and use like a regular app, with its own icon and window, and no app store.

| Platform | How to install |
|---|---|
| **Chrome / Edge (Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS)** | Click **+ Install App** in the sidebar, or the install icon in the address bar |
| **Android (Chrome)** | Tap **+ Install App**, or menu ⋮ → **Install app** |
| **iPhone / iPad (Safari)** | Tap **Share** → **Add to Home Screen** |
| **Mac (Safari 17+)** | **File** → **Add to Dock** |

Once installed:
- It opens in its own window and works with no internet connection
- Your data stays on your device, the same as in the browser. On desktop and Android the installed app shares data with the browser tab. On iPhone/iPad the Home Screen app keeps its own separate copy, so use Export/Import to move existing data into it.
- The app asks the browser to keep its storage persistent so your planner isn't cleared when disk space runs low
- When a new version is published, you'll see **"A new version of Weekflow is available"**. Click **Reload** to update. Your data is kept.

> 💡 Export a backup now and then (**Ctrl+S**). Clearing your browser's site data or uninstalling the app can delete your planner.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

**Built With:**
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Custom properties, Flexbox, Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- SortableJS (bundled in `vendor/`, MIT)
- Manrope and IBM Plex Mono (self-hosted in `assets/fonts/`, SIL OFL 1.1)

**App Files:**
- `manifest.webmanifest` - App name, icons, and colors used when installed
- `sw.js` - Service worker that caches the app for offline use
- `js/pwa.js` - Registers the service worker, shows the update prompt and the install button
- `assets/icons/` - App icons (`icon.svg` is the source; the PNGs are generated from it)

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+

**Data Storage:**
- localStorage (5-10MB limit depending on browser)
- Data persists between sessions
- Export with **Ctrl+S**, import from a JSON backup
- If saved data can't be read, a copy is kept under a `plannerData.corrupt-<timestamp>` key and the app starts fresh

## 🚢 Releasing Updates

The service worker serves the app from a cache, so browsers only pick up changes when `sw.js` itself changes. For every release:

1. Make your changes.
2. If you **added or renamed a file** the app loads, add it to the `APP_SHELL` list in `sw.js`. If any listed file is missing, the update won't install and users stay on the previous version.
3. **Bump `CACHE_VERSION`** in `sw.js` (e.g. `'v2'` → `'v3'`), and change the `?v=` on the CSS/JS links in `index.html` to match (e.g. `?v=3`). The `?v=` makes sure browsers don't combine the new page with an old cached stylesheet or script.
4. If you changed the shape of the saved data, bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `js/planner.js` and add a migration step in `migratePlannerData()`.
5. Deploy. Returning users see the update prompt the next time they open the app.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The design embraces **refined minimalism**:
- Monochrome color palette for reduced visual noise
- IBM Plex Mono for technical precision
- Manrope for readable, modern display text
- Subtle animations and micro-interactions
- Focus on content, not decoration
